# ~~Missed~~ Missing Semester (of Your CS Education)  
Yes, I did get the course title wrong when I initiated this repo and I refuse to change this.  

## What this is  
My personal notes from the [MIT's 'Missing Semester' course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).  
I am completing the course with a study group, some of us are compulsive note takers, some of us share their notes. :nerd_face:  

## What it isn't  
These notes are in no way comprehensive and in no way a good reflection of the course content - the course creators have released official notes, so for valueable content you please refer to the course's website.  
These notes were taken week by week as I was following the videos, and are more of a snapshot of what I got (or didn't get) from the course at the time.  

## Hello :)
From me, for me, my study group and perhaps someone, who somehow ended up in this rabbit hole. Enjoy this repo :popcorn:
